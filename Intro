Project Overview:
This project is based on testing a Weather Forecast API using Postman, a popular API testing tool. The goal is to validate how the API behaves with different inputs and ensure the response is accurate, fast, and structured correctly.

 Objective:
To perform functional testing on the Weather API.

To test positive and negative scenarios.

To ensure the API handles both valid and invalid inputs correctly.

To check response status codes, response time, and data structure.

 -> Tools & Technologies Used:
Postman – to create and send API requests.

JavaScript – to write test scripts in the "Tests" tab.

Postman Test Tab – to validate response body, status code, and time.
